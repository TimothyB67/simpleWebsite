      <h2>BetterHelp</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>About The Industry</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>The company that I am working in is called BetterHelp. BetterHelp is part of the online/virtual mental-health services industry.</p>
                <li>It offers therapy sessions via text, chat, phone or video through a web/app platform.</p>
                <li>It also connects licensed therapists with clients remotely. </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Career in this Organization</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>My role in the BetterHelp Orgainzation is the Head of Marketing.</p>
                <li>As the Head of Marketing I will come up with marketing strategies across major channels such as paid media to suppor engagement and brand value.</p>
                <li>I will also manage budgets and marketing operations with optimization.</p>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Ethical Issues</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>An ethical issue that could arise from my position as the Head of Marketing could be a privacy and data ethic issue.</p>
                <li>The BetterHelp organization collects sensitive information about the users.</p>
                <li>If that sensitive and personal information were to be advertised for marketing purposes, it could break the trust that users have with the organization.</p>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Cybersecurity Issues</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>One cybersecurity issue that could arise is a data breach. The Better Help organization has a large amount of personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI). If a cyber attack were to occur that sensitive data and infromation would be at risk.</p>
                <li>Another cyber security issue that could arise is a third-party risk. BetterHelp relies on third-party partners for analytics, payment processing, video chat, advertising, and customer support. If any of these partners experience a security incident or misuse shared data, it could compromise BetterHelp users.</p>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>The BetterHelp transmits and store large amounts of Protected Health Information (PHI).</p>
                <li>It would be good practice for the organization to encrypt data at rest and in transit, end-to-endencryption for therapies, and minimize the data that is stored by collecting only what is necessary. </p>
                <li>BetterHelp being a teletherapy platfrom, it uses vendors for analytics, payments, customer service, and video hosting. But if a third party vendro were to have a security incident, it could compromise users data. </p>
                <li>It would be best practice to continuosly monitor vendors and re-evalutate them for performance and compliance.</p>
                </ol>
