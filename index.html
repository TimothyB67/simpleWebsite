            <h2>My Top Three Personal Values</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Respect</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>All throughout my life I have known that you should respect everyone regardless of how you feel about them.</p>
                <li>Respect is a two way street, in order to receive it, you must give it.</p>
                <li>Having respect is important because you should treat others the way you want to be treated</p>
                <li>If you don't show others respect they will not respect you either.</p>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Accountability</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>I think that you should always take accountibility for your actions.</p>
                    <li>If you aren't doing what your supposed to be doing in a work place and you get in trouble, take accountibility for your actions.</p>
                    <li>Everyone should be accountable for their own actions whether if they're right or wrong. </p> 
                    <li>when you dont take accountibility for doing or not doing something you would be lettin people down.</p>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Honesty</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>I believe that people should tell the truth even when they are wrong. </p>
                    <li>Growing up I realized that if you are not honest about something, it can get you into even more trouble. </p>
                    <li>People should admit what they do even when they are wrong.</p>
                    <li>If you are not honest about your actions, it can get you into even more trouble or stop you from learning. </p>
                </ol>
